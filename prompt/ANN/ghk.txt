Given the files, generate me a pytest for the acceptance criteria:

Given I have a trained digit recognition model
And  a test set
When I classify the test set using that model
Then  I get an accuracy of more than 95 percent

Use good coding python conventions, and make sure to import any packages / fixture that you use. Do not refer to any non-existent resources. When importing files, take the project structure into account.
